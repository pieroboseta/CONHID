# CONHID: Bulk File Renamer

## Overview
**CONHID** is a powerful, user-friendly bulk file renaming tool designed to simplify the process of organizing large collections of files. With its modern, sleek interface and robust feature set, CONHID allows you to rename files in bulk, restore original names, search through file histories, and even sort files by type. Whether you're managing media libraries, organizing documents, or performing routine file maintenance, CONHID is your go-to solution.

## What It Does
CONHID is built with several key functionalities:
- **Bulk Renaming:** Automatically renames all files in a selected folder using a consistent format (e.g., `document-1.bin`, `document-2.bin`, etc.).
- **Restoration:** Easily restore files to their original names using a saved rename history.
- **Search Functionality:** Quickly search through both renamed and restored files using keywords.
- **Logging System:** Every renaming operation is logged in a JSON file (`conhid.json`), ensuring that changes are tracked and can be reverted if necessary.
- **Modern Aesthetic:** The GUI features a dark-themed interface with uniform buttons for a visually appealing and intuitive experience.

## How It Works
1. **Select a Folder:**
   - Click the **Select** button to open a dialog and choose the folder containing the files you want to manage.
   - Once a folder is selected, CONHID loads all files from that directory.

2. **Rename Files:**
   - Click the **Rename** button to bulk rename all files in the selected folder.
   - Files are renamed following a standard format (e.g., `document-1.bin`, `document-2.bin`, etc.).
   - The original file names are stored in `conhid.json` for later restoration.

3. **Restore Files:**
   - If you need to revert the changes, click the **Restore** button.
   - CONHID reads the rename history from `conhid.json` and renames the files back to their original names.
   - The history for that folder is then cleared from the log.

4. **Full List View:**
   - Click the **Full List** button to open a new window that displays all files from the selected folder.
   
5. **Search:**
   - Enter a search term in the search bar and click the **Search** button.
   - CONHID will filter and display files whose original or new names match the search query.
